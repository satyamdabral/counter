# CHARACTER COUNTER

A simple web application that counts characters in real time as you type.
Total Character Count: See the total number of characters you've typed in the textarea increase as you type. 
Every key you press adds to this count, showing you exactly how much you've written so far.
Remaining Character Count: As you type, you'll notice the number of characters you have left decreases.
This number tells you how much more you can write before you reach the maximum limit. It helps you stay within the set limit and keep your message clear and concise
